# Turborepo monorepo with Next.js starter template

This is a work in progress.

The goal of this is to get more familiar with Monorepos and specifically, Turborepo. I am also using this to dive deeper into Miicrofrontend architecture. The project leverages a Next.js starter template i created for myself, installable as an npm package.

Next steps:

- Create multiple apps to create a microfrontend architecture, leverage Next.js module federation.
- Install Storbook in UI package.
- Convert ui package and shared package into compiled packages (with a dist folder).
