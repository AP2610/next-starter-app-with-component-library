### Components

The component directory follows the architectural pattern of using:

- features
- layout
- ui

These folders provide a space to create feature specific components, layout specific components, and shared UI components.

The features folder is used to contain stand-alone components. Each component can have a additional components which make up the main feature. If these are also feature specific, they can be grouped in the folder of the parent component within the features folder. You can also group feature specific types here.
